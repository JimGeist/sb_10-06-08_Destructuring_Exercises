# sb_10-06-08_Destructuring_Exercises
Exercises involved the destructing objects, arrays, and functions.

Exercises involved predicting the output of some code blocks, changing 2 ES5 code blocks to ES2015 code blocks,
    and writing one function, raceResults(), that takes an input array and returns an object with first, second,
    third, and rest parameters..

Jasmine tests were included to test each part of the exercise.
